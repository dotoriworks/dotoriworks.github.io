    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>In his trade, Alex makes institutional resources usable for more people. Outside of it, he can be found doing local direct action (read: ‘we’re all tired of profit over people; let’s be done with this together’). He compulsively chews on language, process design, and human relationships as something of a life project. He believes in honesty, goodwill, and the wisdom of everyday people.</p>
